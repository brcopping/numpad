# numpad
I am following MrKeeb's and Gondolindrin's video series [PCB from Scratch with Gondo](https://youtu.be/Nk0egpDFqRA) to create my own numpad.

The layout is a standard numpad which can be seen here: [keyboard layout editor](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/febd745a52b943ce2c9e8b8bd37d3d38)

I created [a rough case design](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/cqSrBUfDaGN) for this PCB on tinkercad, it will take a lazercut metal plate for the switch mounting.

Numpad firmware added to [my QMK fork on git](https://github.com/brcopping/qmk_firmware) to genreate firmware run:
`make handwired/ben17:default`


This project is currently a work in progress, nothing has been proven to work yet, I do not advise that you copy me!
