# numpad
I am following MrKeeb's video [PCB from Scratch with Gondo](https://youtu.be/Nk0egpDFqRA) to create my own numpad.

The layout is a standard numpad which can be seen here: [keyboard layout editor](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/febd745a52b943ce2c9e8b8bd37d3d38)

Its currently a work in progress and dosent work.
